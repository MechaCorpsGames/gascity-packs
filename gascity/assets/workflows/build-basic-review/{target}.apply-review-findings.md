Apply build-basic starter review findings.

Use implementation target {{implementation_target}} for any code changes. Read
the starter review synthesis. If all three review lanes approve, write a no-op
review summary. If required fixes or missing evidence remain, make the smallest
focused changes, run the relevant proof commands, and write the review-fix
summary under the build artifact root.

Before editing or running proof commands, read `gc.build.code_review_context_path`
from the workflow root bead and use its `## Implementation Worktrees` section as
the authority for writable code. `gc.work_dir` is the launcher rig root, not the
implementation worktree. Do not inspect or edit the launcher checkout. Select
the implementation worktree for each finding from the source anchor/worktree
recorded in the review context, run `cd "$WORKTREE"`, and verify `pwd -P` equals
that worktree before making changes. Resolve all relative paths in synthesis
findings against the selected worktree. If a required fix cannot be tied to an
implementation worktree, write an iterate summary explaining the missing
worktree evidence and do not patch the launcher root. If multiple worktrees are
listed and a finding is ambiguous, leave it as iterate until the owning worktree
is explicit.

Contract: `gc.work_dir` is the launcher rig root, not the implementation worktree.

Set `code_review.verdict=done` only when acceptance, test evidence, and
simplicity all approve after this pass. Set `code_review.verdict=iterate` when
required fixes remain.

Always close with `gc.outcome=pass`,
`code_review.verdict=done|iterate`,
`code_review.report_path=<starter review summary path>`, and
`code_review.output_path=<starter review summary path>`.

Use the exact claimed bead id when updating metadata. Do not pass freeform notes
or additional positional arguments to `bd update`; unquoted words can resolve to
unrelated beads. Use this command shape:

```bash
bd update "$CLAIMED_BEAD_ID" \
  --set-metadata 'gc.outcome=pass' \
  --set-metadata 'code_review.verdict=done' \
  --set-metadata 'code_review.report_path=<starter review summary path>' \
  --set-metadata 'code_review.output_path=<starter review summary path>'
bd close "$CLAIMED_BEAD_ID" --reason 'Build-basic starter review approved.'
```

Do not invoke provider-native subagents. This starter factory graph lane is the
fix delegation mechanism.
